About the tool
--------------
The following is a simple XML parser I have written in C++ and Windows API for the
Graphical User Interface (GUI). A well-formed XML file is located within the XML parser's release folder.
The XML file contains few of my most favourite games I have played along with some details about the games. 
The parser can successfully parse the XML file and generates a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) 
file from the XML, as well as the capability to generate an XML file from the CSV file. 

Limitations
-----------
- The XML file must have the opening and closing tags in the same line. 
- The XML file must maintain the same amount of tags in each body.
